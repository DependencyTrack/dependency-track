| [Air France-KLM]                     | [@nekhtan]     | Air France-KLM has always been highly vigilant and profoundly committed to the realm of IT security. We use a variety of tools to ensure our systems' safety, one of which is the OWASP Dependency Track. This tool forms a crucial part of our vulnerability detection systems, scanning the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each application and sending it to our in-house DT instance. With over 10,000 projects undergoing daily scans, our security measures are both comprehensive and rigorous. The Dependency Track API is not only highly configurable but also user-friendly, boasting a visually appealing user interface. The project is in a constant state of evolution, adapting and improving to meet the ever-changing landscape of IT security. The community of DT contributors is always ready to lend a hand when issues arise, making it not just an effective tool, but also a pleasure to work with as a developer. We extend our gratitude to the team behind the OWASP Dependency Track for their excellent work. We look forward to welcoming you aboard our flights soon! |
| [Apex Fintech Solutions]             | [@spawar-apex] | Apex Fintech Solutions has integrated OWASP Dependency-Track into their CI/CD pipeline as part of the DevSecOps program. This integration allows for the upload of SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) to the platform for comprehensive component analysis and a detailed understanding of the software inventory used in software applications. By analyzing the components in our monorepo, we enhance our vulnerability management program and gain valuable insights into transitive dependencies, which traditional SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools often overlook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [Dutch Tax Office - Belastingdienst] | [@SudoHenk]    | Dutch Tax Office has integrated OWASP Dependency-Track into their development processes as part of the DevSecOps program. We integrate Dependency-Track with various platforms and programming languages to gain vulnerability insights in our internally developed software. We want to thank all contributors of Dependency-Track creating a resilient and extensible SCA tool. Especially the API is a huge asset to integrate within the current organization processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
