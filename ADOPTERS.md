* [Apex Fintech Solutions](https://apexfintechsolutions.com/) has integrated OWASP Dependency-Track into their CI/CD pipeline as part of the DevSecOps program. This integration allows for the upload of SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) to the platform for comprehensive component analysis and a detailed understanding of the software inventory used in software applications. By analyzing the components in our monorepo, we enhance our vulnerability management program and gain valuable insights into transitive dependencies, which traditional SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools often overlook.
