OWASP Dependency-Track is a Java web application that allows organizations to
document the use of third-party components across multiple applications and
versions. Further, it provides automatic visibility into the use of components
with known vulnerabilities.

The OWASP Top Ten 2013 introduces, for the first time, the use of third-party
components with known vulnerabilities. Dependency-Track aims to document the
usage of all components, the vendors, libraires, versions and licenses used
and provide visibility into the use of vulnerable components.

Development of Dependency-Track is sponsored in part by [Axway]

Installation, configuration and how-to's can be found on the [GitHub Wiki].

General project information can be found on the [OWASP Wiki].
