Dependency-Track is an intelligent [Component Analysis] platform that allows organizations to
identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track takes a unique
and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of [Software Bill of Materials] (SBOM). This approach
provides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.

Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in its portfolio in order to
proactively identify risk across an organization. The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in
CI/CD environments.

### Quickstart (Docker Compose)

```bash
# Downloads the latest Docker Compose file
curl -LO https://dependencytrack.org/docker-compose.yml

# Starts the stack using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Quickstart (Docker Swarm)

```bash
# Downloads the latest Docker Compose file
curl -LO https://dependencytrack.org/docker-compose.yml

# Initializes Docker Swarm (if not previously initialized)
docker swarm init

# Starts the stack using Docker Swarm
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml dtrack
```

### Quickstart (Manual Execution)

```bash
# Pull the image from the Docker Hub OWASP repo
docker pull dependencytrack/bundled

# Creates a dedicated volume where data can be stored outside the container
docker volume create --name dependency-track

# Run the bundled container with 8GB RAM on port 8080
docker run -d -m 8192m -p 8080:8080 --name dependency-track -v dependency-track:/data dependencytrack/bundled
```

**NOTICE: Always use official binary releases in production.**

## Distributions

Dependency-Track has four distribution variants. They are:

| Package | Package Format | Recommended | Supported | Docker | Download |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| API Server | Executable WAR | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 
| Frontend | Single Page Application | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bundled | Executable WAR | ❌ | ☑️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Traditional WAR | WAR | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |


#### API Server

The API Server contains an embedded Jetty server and all server-side functionality, but excludes the frontend user
interface. This variant is new as of Dependency-Track v4.0.

#### Frontend

The Frontend is the user interface that is accessible in a web browser. The Frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA)
that can be deployed independently of the Dependency-Track API Server. This variant is new as of Dependency-Track v3.8.

#### Bundled

The Bundled variant combines the API Server and the Frontend user interface. This variant was previously referred to as
the executable war and was the preferred distribution from Dependency-Track v3.0 - v3.8. This variant is supported but
deprecated and will be discontinued in a future release.

#### Traditional

The Traditional variant combines the API Server and the Frontend user interface and must be deployed to a Servlet
container. This variant is not supported, deprecated, and will be discontinued in a future release.


## Deploying on Kubernetes with Helm
You can install on Kubernetes using the [community-maintained chart](https://github.com/evryfs/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/dependency-track) like this:

```shell
helm repo add evryfs-oss https://evryfs.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install evryfs-oss/dependency-track --name dependency-track --namespace dependency-track
```
by default, it will install PostgreSQL and use persistent volume claims for the data-directory used for vulnerability feeds.


## Compiling From Sources (optional)
To create the API Server executable WAR that is ready to launch:

```shell
mvn clean package -P embedded-jetty
```

To create the API Server executable WAR that is ready to be deployed in a Docker container:

```shell
mvn clean package -P embedded-jetty -Dlogback.configuration.file=src/main/docker/logback.xml
```

To create the Bundled (API Server + Frontend) executable WAR that is ready to be deployed in a Docker container:

```shell
mvn clean package -P embedded-jetty -P bundle-ui -Dlogback.configuration.file=src/main/docker/logback.xml
```
