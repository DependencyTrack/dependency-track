# Reporting Security Issues

The Dependency-Track team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security@dependencytrack.org](mailto:security@dependencytrack.org) and [steve.springett@owasp.org](mailto:steve.springett@owasp.org) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The Dependency-Track team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
