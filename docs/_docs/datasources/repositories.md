Dependency-Track relies on integration with repositories to help identify metadata that may be useful
for the identification of risk. Package repositories to manage and automatically resolve dependencies.

Dependency-Track incorporates the concept of repositories, completely independent of software engineering use-cases,
as a way to gain additional intelligence about the components it's tracking. Dependency-Track brings the power of
package repositories to every project the system tracks, whether the project is developed internally or commercial
off-the-shelf software.

Dependency-Track supports the following default repositories:

| Ecosystem  | Repository       | Resolution Order |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| cargo      | Crates.io        | 1 |
| composer   | Packagist        | 1 |
| gem        | RubyGems         | 1 |
| go modules | proxy.golang.org | 1 |
| hex        | Hex              | 1 |
| maven      | Maven Central    | 1 |
|            | Atlassian Public | 2 |
|            | JBoss Releases   | 3 |
|            | Clojars          | 4 |
|            | Google Android   | 5 |
| npm        | NPM              | 1 |
| nuget      | NuGet            | 1 |
| pypi       | PyPi             | 1 |
| cpan       | CPAN             | 1 |


Additional repositories can be added for each supported ecosystem. Additionally, repositories can be enabled or disabled
as well as identified as 'internal'. For internal repositories, a username and/or password may be specified. This allows
Dependency-Track to scan packages from private repositories that require basic authentication, like Azure Artifacts or
Artifactory.

> Components that are identified as 'internal' will only be analyzed using 'internal' repositories. Non-internal
> components will only be analyzed using non-internal repositories. Disabled repositories will be omitted from
> component metadata analysis.


### Outdated Version Tracking

One primary use-case for the support of repositories is the identification of outdated components. By leveraging tight
integration with APIs available from various repositories, the platform can identify outdated versions of components
across multiple ecosystems. Dependency-Track relies on Package URL (PURL) to identify the ecosystem a component belongs
to, the metadata about the component, and uses that data to query the various repositories capable of supporting the
components ecosystem.

Package URL is natively supported in the [CycloneDX](http://cyclonedx.org/) BOM specification. By using CycloneDX as a
means to populate project dependencies, organizations benefit from the many use-cases Package URL provides, including
leveraging repositories to identify outdated components.

for information on Package URL and the various ways it is used throughout Dependency-Track.
