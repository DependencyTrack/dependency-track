Dependency-Track has three distribution variants. They are:

| Package    | Package Format          | Recommended | Supported | Docker | Download |
|:-----------|:------------------------|:-----------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------:|
| API Server | Executable WAR          |      ✅      |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅     | 
| Frontend   | Single Page Application |      ✅      |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅     |
| Bundled    | Executable WAR          |      ❌      |    ☑️     |   ✅    |    ✅     |

### API Server

The API Server contains an embedded Jetty server and all server-side functionality, but excludes the frontend user
interface. This variant is new as of Dependency-Track v4.0.

### Frontend

The Frontend is the user interface that is accessible in a web browser. The Frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA)
that can be deployed independently of the Dependency-Track API Server. This variant is new as of Dependency-Track v3.8.

### Bundled

The Bundled variant combines the API Server and the Frontend user interface. This variant was previously referred to as
the executable war and was the preferred distribution from Dependency-Track v3.0 - v3.8. This variant is supported but
deprecated and will be discontinued in a future release.
