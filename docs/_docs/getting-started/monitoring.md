The API server can be configured to expose system metrics via the Prometheus [text-based exposition format].
They can then be collected and visualized using tools like [Prometheus] and [Grafana]. Especially for containerized
deployments where directly attaching to the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is not possible, monitoring 
system metrics via Prometheus is crucial for observability.

> System metrics are not the same as portfolio metrics exposed via `/api/v1/metrics` REST API or

> the application itself, not the data managed by it. If exposition of portfolio statistics via Prometheus is desired,
> refer to [community integrations] like Jetstack's [dependency-track-exporter].

To enable metrics exposition, set the `alpine.metrics.enable` property to `true` (see [Configuration]). 
Metrics will be exposed in the `/metrics` endpoint, and can optionally be protected using 
basic authentication via `alpine.metrics.auth.username` and `alpine.metrics.auth.password`.

### Exposed Metrics

Exposed metrics include various general purpose system and JVM statistics (CPU and Heap usage, thread states, 
garbage collector activity etc.), but also some related to Dependency-Track's internal event and notification system.
More metrics covering other areas of Dependency-Track will be added in future versions.

Event and notification metrics include the following:

```yaml
# HELP alpine_events_published_total Total number of published events
# TYPE alpine_events_published_total counter
alpine_events_published_total{event="<EVENT_CLASS_NAME>",publisher="<PUBLISHER_CLASS_NAME>",} 1.0
# HELP alpine_notifications_published_total Total number of published notifications
# TYPE alpine_notifications_published_total counter
alpine_notifications_published_total{group="<NOTIFICATION_GROUP>",level="<NOTIFICATION_LEVEL>",scope="<NOTIFICATION_SCOPE>",} 1.0
```

> `alpine_notifications_published_total` will report all notifications, not only those for which an alert has been configured.

Events and notifications are processed by [executors]. The executor *Alpine-EventService* corresponds to what is 
typically referred to as *worker pool*, and is responsible for executing the majority of events in Dependency-Track.
*Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService* is a dedicated executor for events that can't safely be executed in parallel.
The following executor metrics are available:

```yaml
# HELP executor_pool_max_threads The maximum allowed number of threads in the pool
# TYPE executor_pool_max_threads gauge
executor_pool_max_threads{name="Alpine-NotificationService",} 4.0
executor_pool_max_threads{name="Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService",} 1.0
executor_pool_max_threads{name="Alpine-EventService",} 40.0
# HELP executor_pool_core_threads The core number of threads for the pool
# TYPE executor_pool_core_threads gauge
executor_pool_core_threads{name="Alpine-NotificationService",} 4.0
executor_pool_core_threads{name="Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService",} 1.0
executor_pool_core_threads{name="Alpine-EventService",} 40.0
# HELP executor_pool_size_threads The current number of threads in the pool
# TYPE executor_pool_size_threads gauge
executor_pool_size_threads{name="Alpine-NotificationService",} 0.0
executor_pool_size_threads{name="Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService",} 1.0
executor_pool_size_threads{name="Alpine-EventService",} 7.0
# HELP executor_active_threads The approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks
# TYPE executor_active_threads gauge
executor_active_threads{name="Alpine-NotificationService",} 0.0
executor_active_threads{name="Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService",} 1.0
executor_active_threads{name="Alpine-EventService",} 2.0
# HELP executor_completed_tasks_total The approximate total number of tasks that have completed execution
# TYPE executor_completed_tasks_total counter
executor_completed_tasks_total{name="Alpine-NotificationService",} 0.0
executor_completed_tasks_total{name="Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService",} 0.0
executor_completed_tasks_total{name="Alpine-EventService",} 5.0
# HELP executor_queued_tasks The approximate number of tasks that are queued for execution
# TYPE executor_queued_tasks gauge
executor_queued_tasks{name="Alpine-NotificationService",} 0.0
executor_queued_tasks{name="Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService",} 160269.0
executor_queued_tasks{name="Alpine-EventService",} 0.0
# HELP executor_queue_remaining_tasks The number of additional elements that this queue can ideally accept without blocking
# TYPE executor_queue_remaining_tasks gauge
executor_queue_remaining_tasks{name="Alpine-NotificationService",} 2.147483647E9
executor_queue_remaining_tasks{name="Alpine-SingleThreadedEventService",} 2.147323378E9
executor_queue_remaining_tasks{name="Alpine-EventService",} 2.147483647E9
```

Executor metrics are a good way to monitor how busy an API server instance is, and how good of a job it's
doing keeping up with the work it's being exposed to. For example, a constantly maxed-out `executor_active_threads` 
value combined with a high number of `executor_queued_tasks` may indicate that the configured `alpine.worker.pool.size` 
is too small for the workload at hand.

### Grafana Dashboard

Because [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) is used to collect and expose metrics, common Grafana dashboards for
Micrometer should just work.

An [example dashboard] is provided as a quickstart. Refer to the [Grafana documentation] for instructions on how to import it.

> The example dashboard is meant to be a starting point. Users are strongly encouraged to explore the available metrics
> and build their own dashboards, tailored to their needs. The sample dashboard is not actively maintained by the project
> team, however community contributions are more than welcome.
