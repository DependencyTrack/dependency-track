> OpenID Connect is supported in Dependency-Track 4.0.0 and above

In the context of OAuth2 / OIDC, Dependency-Track's frontend acts as *client* while the API server acts as *resource server* (see [OAuth2 roles](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.1)).
Due to this, the frontend requires additional configuration, which is currently only supported when deploying it separately from the API server.
Refer to the [Configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/configuration.md %}) and [Docker deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/deploy-docker.md %}) pages for instructions. "Classic" Dependency-Track deployments using solely the [WAR]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/deploy-war.md %}) or [executable WAR]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/deploy-exewar.md %}) are not supported!

If configured properly, users will be able to sign in by clicking the *OpenID* button on the login page:
![Login page with OpenID button](/images/screenshots/oidc-login-page.png)

### Example Configurations

Generally, Dependency-Track can be used with any identity provider that implements the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) standard.
Multiple identity providers have been tested, the following are some example configurations that are known to work. 
Note that some providers may not support specific features like team synchronization, or require further configuration to make them work.
If you find that the provider of your choice does not work with Dependency-Track, please [file an issue](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues).

For a complete overview of available configuration options for both backend and frontend, please refer to the [Configuration page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/configuration.md %}).

> gitlab.com currently does not set the required CORS headers, see GitLab issue [#209259](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209259).  
> For on-premise installations, this could be fixed by setting the required headers via reverse proxy.

### Example setup with Keycloak

The following steps demonstrate how to setup OpenID Connect with Keycloak. Most settings should be applicable to other IdPs as well.

> This guide assumes that: 
>   * the Dependency-Track frontend has been deployed to `http://dependencytrack.example.com`
>   * a Keycloak instance is available at `https://auth.example.com`
>   * the realm *example* has been created in Keycloak

1. Configure the client as shown below:
![Keycloak: Configure client](/images/screenshots/oidc-keycloak-client-settings.png)
  * Client ID: `dependency-track`
  * Access Type: `public`
  * Standard Flow Enabled: `ON`
  * Valid Redirect URIs: `http://dependencytrack.example.com/static/oidc-callback.html`
  * Web Origins: `http://dependencytrack.example.com`

2. To be able to synchronize team memberships, create a *protocol mapper* that includes group memberships as `groups` in
the `/userinfo` endpoint:
![Keycloak: Create protocol mapper for groups](/images/screenshots/oidc-keycloak-create-protocol-mapper.png) 
  * Mapper Type: `Group Membership`
  * Token Claim Name: `groups`
  * Add to userinfo: `ON`

3. Create some groups, e.g. `DTRACK_ADMINS` and `DTRACK_USERS`:
![Keycloak: Groups](/images/screenshots/oidc-keycloak-groups.png)

4. Verify that all required claims are present in the `/userinfo` endpoint
  * Acquire an access token for a user and call `/userinfo` with it
  * You can temporarily set *Direct Access Grants Enabled* to `ON` in the client settings to enable the [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3)
```
$ ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl https://auth.example.com/auth/realms/example/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -d "client_id=dependency-track" \
    -d "grant_type=password" \
    -d "username=demo-user" \
    -d "password=demo-pass" \
    | jq -r .access_token)
$ curl https://auth.example.com/auth/realms/example/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
  * The response should look similar to this:
```json
{
  "groups": ["DTRACK_USERS"],
  "sub": "290e5d27-25d2-414c-a04c-5d03cd0e1db8",
  "email_verified": true,
  "preferred_username": "demo-user",
  "email": "demo@example.com"
}
```

5. Configure OIDC for both backend and frontend of Dependency-Track, as demonstrated below for a docker-compose deployment:

    ```yaml
    version: "3"

    services:
      dtrack:
        image: dependencytrack/dependency-track
        environment:
          # ...
          - "ALPINE_OIDC_ENABLED=true"
          - "ALPINE_OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.example.com/auth/realms/example"
          - "ALPINE_OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM=preferred_username"
          - "ALPINE_OIDC_TEAMS_CLAIM=groups"
          - "ALPINE_OIDC_USER_PROVISIONING=true"
          - "ALPINE_OIDC_TEAM_SYNCHRONIZATION=true"

      dtrack-frontend:
        image: dependencytrack/frontend
        environment:
          # ...
          - "OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.example.com/auth/realms/example"
          - "OIDC_CLIENT_ID=dependency-track"
    ```

6. Login to Dependency-Track as `admin` and navigate to *Administration -> Access Management -> OpenID Connect Groups*
  * Create groups with names equivalent to those in Keycloak
  * Add teams that the groups should be mapped to
![Group mappings](/images/screenshots/oidc-groups.png)

7. Use the *OpenID* button on the login page to sign in with a Keycloak user that is member of at least one of the configured groups. Navigating to *Administration -> Access Management -> OpenID Connect Users* should now reveal that the user has been automatically provisioned and team memberships have been synchronized:
![OIDC User](/images/screenshots/oidc-user.png)

> Dependency-Track associates every OpenID Connect user with their subject identifier (`sub` claim of the access token) upon first login.
> If a user with the same name but a different subject identifier attempts to log in via OIDC, Dependency-Track will refuse to authenticate that user. This is done to prevent account takeovers, as some identity providers allow users to change their usernames. Also, uniqueness of usernames is not always guaranteed, while the uniqueness of subject identifiers is.
