Dependency-Track consumes and analyzes CycloneDX BOMs at high-velocity and is ideal for use in modern build pipelines. 
The generation of CycloneDX BOMs often occur during CI or when the final application assembly is being generated.

Visit the [CycloneDX Tool Center](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/) for information on the available tools for 
generating CycloneDX BOMs from various build systems.

> Dependency-Track continuously monitors components for known vulnerabilities. When components are added or 
> updated in Dependency-Track, an analysis is performed against the component. This action occurs during 
> ingestion of files as well as changes to the components via REST or from the user interface. All 
> components in Dependency-Track, regardless of changes, are automatically analyzed on a daily basis.

The [Dependency-Track Jenkins Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dependency-track/) is the 
recommended method for publishing CycloneDX BOMs to Dependency-Track in a Jenkins environment.

For GitHub workflow environments the
[Dependency-Track GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-bom-to-dependency-track)
is recommended.

For other environments, cURL (or similar) can be used. 

#### CycloneDX
To publish CycloneDX BOMs, use a valid API Key and project UUID. Finally, Base64 encode the 
BOM and insert the resulting text into the 'bom' field.

```bash
curl -X "PUT" "http://dtrack.example.com/api/v1/bom" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'X-API-Key: LPojpCDSsEd4V9Zi6qCWr4KsiF3Konze' \
     -d $'{
  "project": "f90934f5-cb88-47ce-81cb-db06fc67d4b4",
  "bom": "PD94bWwgdm..."
  }'
```

It's also possible to publish BOMs via HTTP POST which does not require Base64 encoding the payload.
 
```bash
curl -X "POST" "http://dtrack.example.com/api/v1/bom" \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H 'X-Api-Key: LPojpCDSsEd4V9Zi6qCWr4KsiF3Konze' \
     -F "project=f90934f5-cb88-47ce-81cb-db06fc67d4b4" \
     -F "bom=<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>..."
```

#### Large Payloads
In cases where the scan or BOM being uploaded is large, using cURL's capability of specifying a file
containing a payload may be preferred.

```bash
curl -X "PUT" "http://dtrack.example.com/api/v1/bom" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'X-API-Key: LPojpCDSsEd4V9Zi6qCWr4KsiF3Konze' \
     -d @payload.json
```

### Alternative parameters
In lieu of specifying the UUID of an existing project, the project name and version can be specified as an alternative. 
If the project does not exist, it can optionally be automatically created using the `autoCreate` parameter.

```bash
curl -X "POST" "http://dtrack.example.com/api/v1/bom" \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H "X-Api-Key: xxxxxxx" \
     -F "autoCreate=true" \
     -F "projectName=xxxx" \
     -F "projectVersion=xxxx" \
     -F "bom=@target/bom.xml"
```

You can also create a project as a child to some other project if you add `parentUUID` or `parentName` parameters.

```bash
curl -X "POST" "http://dtrack.example.com/api/v1/bom" \
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
     -H "X-Api-Key: xxxxxxx" \
     -F "autoCreate=true" \
     -F "projectName=xxxx" \
     -F "projectVersion=xxxx.SNAPSHOT" \
     -F "parentName=xxxx" \
     -F "parentVersion=xxxx" \
     -F "bom=@target/bom.xml"
```
