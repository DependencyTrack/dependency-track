Organizations can analyze the potential for impact of a vulnerability in their environment.
Dependency-Track can help identify all affected projects across the organization. If the vulnerability is published
to a datasource Dependency-Track supports (i.e. NVD, GitHub Advisories, OSS Index, VulnDB, etc), then simply looking up the
vulnerability in the platform is all that's required.

Using Dependency-Track can help organizations answer two important questions:
- What is affected?
- Where am I affected?

Dependency-Track contains a full mirror for each of the vulnerability datasources it supports. Virtually all public
information about the vulnerability including the description, affected versions, CWE, and severity, are captured,
as well as the affected projects. The list of affected projects is dynamically generated based on data in
Dependency-Track at the time of inquiry.

Alternatively, if the component name and version are known, then performing a search on that component will
reveal a list of vulnerabilities, as well as a list of all projects that have a dependency on the component.
