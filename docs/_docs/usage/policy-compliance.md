Organizations can create policies and measure policy violations across the portfolio, and against individual 
projects and components. Policies are configurable and can be enforced for the portfolio, or can be 
limited to specific projects. Policies are evaluated when an SBOM is uploaded.

There are three types of policy violations:
* License
* Security
* Operational

## License Violation
Policy conditions can specify zero or more SPDX license IDs as well as license groups. Dependency-Track comes with
pre-configured groups of related licenses (e.g. Copyleft) that provide a starting point for organizations to create
custom license policies.

## Security Violation
Policy conditions can specify the severity of vulnerabilities. A vulnerability affecting a component can result in a 
policy violation if the policy condition matches the severity of the vulnerability. Vulnerabilities that are suppressed
will not result in a policy violation.

## Operational Violation
Policy conditions can specify zero or more:
* Coordinates (group, name, version)
* Package URL
* CPE
* SWID Tag ID
* Hash (MD5, SHA, SHA3, Blake2b, Blake3)

This allows organizations to create lists of allowable and/or prohibited components. Future versions
of Dependency-Track will incorporate additional operational parameters into the policy framework.
