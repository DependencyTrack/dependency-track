**Upgrade Notes:**

This release of Dependency-Track supports a wide range of LDAP implementations and has been tested with 
Active Directory, ApacheDS, Fedora 389 Directory, and NetIQ/Novell eDirectory. In order to ensure compatibility,
some existing LDAP configuration properties have been changed.


```ini
# This property has been removed
alpine.ldap.domain
```

```ini
# This property now refers to the users DN
alpine.ldap.bind.username
```

```ini
# Format now applies only to the value of alpine.ldap.attribute.name. 
# Examples have been modified. A users DN is no longer a valid format.
alpine.ldap.auth.username.format
```

```ini
# New properties
alpine.ldap.groups.filter
alpine.ldap.user.groups.filter
alpine.ldap.user.provisioning
alpine.ldap.team.synchronization
```
