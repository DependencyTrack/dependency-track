Two new LDAP properties were introduced in v3.5.0 that affect LDAP configuration. The properties are:

* alpine.ldap.groups.search.filter
* alpine.ldap.users.search.filter

Refer to [Configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/configuration.md %})
and [Deploying Docker Container]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/deploy-docker.md %})
for details.

Additional properties introduced in this release are:
* alpine.database.pool.enabled
* alpine.database.pool.max.size
* alpine.database.pool.idle.timeout
* alpine.database.pool.max.lifetime

Under most situations, changing these values is not recommended and may introduce unintended consequences. 
One important change introduced in this release is the default value of `alpine.database.pool.max.lifetime`
has changed from 30 minutes (in previous releases) to 10 minutes.
