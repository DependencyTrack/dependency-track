**Upgrade Notes:**
* OpenID Connect: To facilitate support for post-login redirects, the *valid redirect URIs* client setting in IdPs *may* need to be updated. Refer to the [OIDC documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/openidconnect-configuration.md %}) for details.
* The internal port the frontend container listens on has changed from port 80 to port 8080. docker-compose files may need to be updated to reflect this change. Updated compose files are [available for download](https://dependencytrack.org/docker-compose.yml).
* Starting with Dependency-Track v4.2, the API Server and the Frontend now have the same major and minor (semantic) version. Patch versions however, may continue to be unique.
