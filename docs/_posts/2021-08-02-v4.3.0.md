type: major

**Features:**
* Implemented Portfolio Access Control (beta) - [#140](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/140)
* OpenID Connect: Source user claims from `/userinfo` *and* ID token - [#1008](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/140)
  * Resolves an issue where some IdPs would provide specific claims only in one and not the other of the two
* Added Go Modules repository support
* Added timeout for idle transactions - [#941](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/941)
* Components with missing or unknown license are now evaluated against policy condition - [#1105](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1105)

**Fixes:**
* Resolved issue where active projects could only be displayed when showing inactive projects - [#963](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/963)
* Resolved high load issues with Postgres while simultaneously increasing performance for all database platforms - [#1026](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1026)
* Resolved issue with OSS Index where PURLs without a version will lead to scan failure - [#1115](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1115)

**Security:**

Portfolio ACL logic has been implemented. In its current form, Portfolio Access Control is a beta feature in v4.3. As a result, the project will not treat bypass or absent ACL logic as a security defect. There are a few known gaps in ACL logic that will exist in v4.3. These gaps are tracked in [#1127](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1127).

ACL logic covers:
* /v1/bom/*
  * Uploading SBOMs to projects or exporting SBOMs from projects or components
* v1/component/*
  * CRUD operations on components
* /v1/finding/*
  * Security findings for projects and components
* /v1/metrics/*
  * Project and component metrics
* /v1/project/*
  * _RUD operations on projects
* /v1/service/*
  * CRUD operations on components
* /v1/violation/*
  * Project and component policy violations
* /v1/vulnerability/*
  * CRUD operations on vulnerable projects or components

The user interface clearly states that Portfolio Access Control is beta. By default, Portfolio Access Control is disabled.

**Upgrade Notes:**
* OpenID Connect: The client ID of the frontend has to be passed to the API server via the `alpine.oidc.client.id` property
  * Required for the API server to be able to validate ID tokens. Refer to the [OIDC documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/getting-started/openidconnect-configuration.md %}) for details.
* Removed legacy support for SPDX (RDF and tag/value) - [#1053](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1053)
* Removed legacy support for the traditional WAR (was previously deprecated and unsupported) - [#1070](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1070)
