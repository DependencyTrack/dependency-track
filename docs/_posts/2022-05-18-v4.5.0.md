**Upgrade Notes:**
* The `nist` directory inside the Dependency-Track data directory will be deleted upon upgrade. This will force the NVD to be downloaded and reprocessed.
* Users and teams with `POLICY_VIOLATION_ANALYSIS` permission are automatically granted the `VIEW_POLICY_VIOLATION` permission during the automatic upgrade.
* Location of `config.json` in the frontend container changed from `/app/static/config.json` to `/opt/owasp/dependency-track-frontend/static/config.json`
