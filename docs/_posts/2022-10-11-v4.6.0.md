title: v4.6.0
type: major
---

**Highlights:**

* **Vulnerability Aliases**. By ingesting data from multiple sources of vulnerability intelligence, 
there will be cases where different advisories describe the same vulnerability. 
For example, [CVE-2022-31197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31197) and 
[GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2) describe the same defect, 
yet their descriptions and risk ratings differ. Dependency-Track 4.6 now recognizes when multiple advisories alias each other, 
and includes this information in notifications and REST API responses. Aliases will additionally be considered when 
calculating portfolio metrics, so that duplicate vulnerabilities do not skyrocket the risk scoring. 
Further improvements to aliases will be coming in future releases.
* **OSV Integration (Beta)**. Dependency-Track now optionally mirrors vulnerability intelligence data from the Open Source 
Vulnerabilities database ([OSV](https://osv.dev/)). OSV normalizes and enriches data from multiple other
vulnerability databases. Mirroring can be limited to a configurable selection of ecosystems.
* **New Policy Conditions**.
  * Using the tag condition, policies can be restricted to projects with certain properties or priorities (e.g. *high-risk*, *internet-facing*, etc.)
  * Using the CWE condition, policies can assist in prioritizing findings of certain weaknesses
  * Using the component hash condition, policies can be used to flag usage of malicious or tainted packages
* **Performance**. Various improvements, most prominently regarding metrics updates.
Organizations, especially those with large portfolios of multiple thousands of projects, will see a drastic reduction 
in runtime and resource usage.
* **Observability**. By exposition of system metrics via the Prometheus text-based format, operators can now monitor 
their instances using Prometheus, Grafana, or other compatible observability stacks. Metrics exposition is optional 
and must be enabled, refer to the [monitoring] documentation for details.
* **Customization**. Users with advanced customization needs can now create and modify notification templates, 
as well as specify custom intervals for recurring tasks. Refer to the [notifications] and [recurring tasks]
documentation for details.
* **Authentication for Internal Repositories**. Dependency-Track can now authenticate with artifact repositories
like Nexus Repository Manager or Artifactory to fetch information about internal artifacts.

**Security:**

* Fixed a defect that could cause API keys to be logged in clear text when handling API requests using keys with insufficient permissions - [GHSA-gh7v-4hxp-gqp4]

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The new baseline Java version is 17 ([#1804])
  * Java versions later than 17 may work as well, but haven't been tested
  * Users deploying DT via [executable WAR] will need to upgrade Java accordingly
  * Users deploying DT via [containers] don't need to do anything
* The embedded H2 database has been upgraded to major version 2
  * Manual upgrade steps are required, refer to the [H2 v2 migration guide]
  * **Without the manual migration, Dependency-Track 4.6 will not work with H2 databases created by earlier versions**
  * **Reminder**: H2 is not, and never has been, supported for production usage
* With [#1429], handling of notification levels has changed 
  * Previously, an alert with level `ERROR` would trigger on notifications with levels `ERROR`, `WARNING`, and `INFORMATIONAL`
  * Now, an alert with level `ERROR` will only trigger on notifications with level `ERROR`
  * An alert with level `WARNING` will trigger on notifications with level `WARNING` and `ERROR` etc.
  * The new behavior is similar to how structured logging libraries work
  * This change primarily affects notifications of the `SYSTEM` scope, which are used to report statuses of various tasks, e.g. `DATASOURCE_MIRRORING`
  * Notifications in the `PORTFOLIO` scope (e.g. `NEW_VULNERABILITY`) all have the `INFORMATIONAL` level
  * Users who configured alerts with scope `PORTFOLIO` and level `ERROR` should change the level to `INFORMATIONAL` after the upgrade
