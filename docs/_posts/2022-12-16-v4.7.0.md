title: v4.7.0
type: major
---

**Highlights:**

* **Hierarchical Project Relationships**. Projects can now be organized in hierarchies, using simple 
parent-child-relationships. Hierarchies are visualized in the UI, and allow projects to inherit various 
configurations from their parent, including notification rules and applicable policies.
* **Improved Dependency Graph**. The dependency graph can now be displayed in its entirety. Previously, the depth was
limited to only three levels. Additionally, it's now possible to navigate from a specific component (e.g. from the
*Audit Vulnerabilities* tab) directly to the dependency graph. In doing so, Dependency-Track will show all paths in
the graph leading up to this component, making it easy to understand how a given component is introduced to the project.
* **Snyk Integration (Beta)**. Dependency-Track can now make use of [Snyk] to scan and continuously monitor components
for vulnerabilities. This provides access to Snyk's proprietary vulnerability database, maintained by their dedicated 
research team. The Snyk integration requires a paid subscription with REST API access.
* **Jira Integration**. It is now possible to publish notifications to Jira, making it easier to integrate events that
require action to be taken into existing Jira workflows.

* Added ability to [configure the secret key path] - [apiserver/#2238]

**Fixes:**

* Fix dependency graph only showing 3 levels of transitive relationships - [frontend/#85]

instead of `latest` - [apiserver/#2075]

* Fix CPEs not matching on identical versions - [apiserver/#2240]
* Fix inability to delete teams that are part of one or more ACL - [apiserver/#1532]

**Upgrade Notes:**

* Creating new or searching for existing tags will now treat tag names as case-insensitive ([apiserver/#1717]).
Users relying on tags being treated as case-sensitive (e.g. `critical` and `CRITICAL` being treated as different)
should review their use of tags prior to upgrading.
* Names of the HikariCP connection pools in the exposed Prometheus metrics have changed from `HikariPool-3` and
`HikariPool-4` to `transactional` and `non-transactional` ([apiserver/#2238]). Users monitoring those pools are advised 
to update their monitoring configuration accordingly (e.g. Grafana dashboards).
* Distribution of the API server SBOM in XML format has been dropped ([apiserver/#2175]).
Users consuming the API server BOM in XML format should migrate to consuming the JSON-formatted BOM instead.
