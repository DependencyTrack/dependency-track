**Celebrating 10 years of OWASP Dependency-Track**

Dependency-Track is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year!  
Read the announcement from Steve Springett, creator of Dependency-Track, on [the OWASP blog](https://owasp.org/blog/2023/01/10/Celebrating-10-years-of-Dependency-Track.html).

**Highlights:**

* **Improved frontend UX**.
  * Navigating through the UI, switching tabs etc. now properly updates the URL in the browser.
  This makes it possible to share links to specific pages with others, and not lose context entirely when using the browser's
  "go back" functionality.
  * Criteria for the component search is now encoded in the URL, which allows "deep-linking" to searches, making it easier
  to collaborate with colleagues.
  * The UI will now remember various user preferences, i.e. selected columns, numbers of search results per page,
  whether to show inactive projects, and much more.
  * The dependency graph now optionally displays indicator icons for outdated components.
* **Polished policy engine.** The policy engine received lots of love in this release, ranging from various bugfixes,
  to newly supported policy conditions.
* **Reduced resource footprint for vulnerability database mirroring**. Downloading and processing vulnerability
  data from the NVD, GitHub, and OSV has historically been a heavy task that could cause large spikes in JVM heap usage.
  Due to various improvements, mirroring will now be faster, and a lot more lightweight (see [apiserver/#2575] for
  comparisons).
