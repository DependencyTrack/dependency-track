**Upgrade Notes:**

* API keys generated after the upgrade will be prefixed with `odt_`. Existing API keys without this prefix will
continue to work. The prefix is configurable via `alpine.api.key.prefix`, although customization is not recommended.
Refer to [Configuration] for details.
* Users ingesting SBOMs with CPE data may notice an uptick in vulnerabilities being identified by the internal analyzer.
This is expected as a result of [apiserver/#2988] being fixed. If newly identified vulnerabilities turn out to be largely
false positives, let the project team know by [reporting a defect].
