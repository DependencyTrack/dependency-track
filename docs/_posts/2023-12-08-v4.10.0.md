title: v4.10.0
type: major
---

Dependency-Track has historically relied on file-based data feeds to mirror contents of the National Vulnerability
Database (NVD). These feeds are being [retired on December 15th 2023](https://nvd.nist.gov/General/News/change-timeline),
although they [may be available up until December 18th](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/nvd-news/c/a4bDL8nofOk).

As a consequence, this release includes support for mirroring the NVD via its REST API instead. This integration
will be optional for Dependency-Track v4.10, but mandatory for later releases. Users are encouraged to enable
REST API mirroring now, to ensure a smooth transition. Refer to the [NVD datasource documentation] to learn more.

**Features:**

* Add support for mirroring the NVD via its REST API - [apiserver/#3175]
  * Refer to the [NVD datasource documentation] for details
* Add retries with exponential backoff for NVD feed downloads - [apiserver/#3154]
* Add support for CycloneDX `metadata.supplier`, `metadata.manufacturer`, `metadata.authors`, and `component.supplier` - [apiserver/#3090], [apiserver/#3179]
* Add support for authenticating with public / non-internal repositories - [apiserver/#2876]
* Add support for fetching latest versions from GitHub - [apiserver/#3112]
  * Applicable to components with `pkg:github/<owner>/<repository>@<version>` package URLs
* Improve efficiency of search index operations - [apiserver/#3116]
* Add option to emit log for successfully published notifications, and improve logging around notifications in general - [apiserver/#3211]
* Use Java 21 JRE in container images - [apiserver/#3089]
* Tweak container health check to prevent `wget` zombie processes on slow hosts - [apiserver/#3245]
* Expose `alpine_event_processing_seconds` metric for monitoring of event processing durations
* Add average event processing duration to Grafana dashboard - [apiserver/#3173]
* Add guidance for `413 Content Too Large` errors upon BOM upload - [apiserver/#3167]
* Improve OIDC documentation - [apiserver/#3186]
* Add "Show in Dependency-Graph" button to component search results - [frontend/#572]

**Fixes:**

* Fix false positives in CPE matching due to ambiguous *vendor*-*product* relations - [apiserver/#3209]
* Fix failure to delete policy violations when they have an audit trail - [apiserver/#3228]
* Fix teams not being assignable to alerts with custom email publishers - [apiserver/#3232]
* Fix inability to rebuild search indexes for more than one entity type at a time - [apiserver/#2987]
* Fix trailing comma in default Slack notification template - [apiserver/#3172]
* Fix NPE when affected node in OSV does not define a package - [apiserver/#3194]
* Fix NPE for BOM_PROCESSING_FAILED notifications when parsing of the BOM failed - [apiserver/#3198]
* Fix gradual performance degradation of portfolio vulnerability analysis - [apiserver/#3222]
* Fix erroneous warning log during VEX import - [apiserver/#3233]
* Fix `project.active` defaulting to `false` when creating projects via REST API - [apiserver/#3244]
* Fix OIDC login button moving before it can be clicked - [frontend/#616]
* Fix input fields losing focus while editing alerts - [frontend/#619]
* Fix switching between project versions being broken on tabs other than "Overview" - [frontend/#659]
* Fix notification level not being modifiable for existing alerts - [frontend/#661]

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The `CPE` table is no longer needed and will be dropped automatically upon upgrade - [apiserver/#3117]
* A warning will be logged when mirroring the NVD through its legacy data feeds
  * Refer to the [NVD datasource documentation] to learn how to switch to API-based mirroring
* As the Grafana dashboard is not managed by Dependency-Track, users wishing to update it will need
  to re-import it into their Grafana instance.
