type: patch
---

This release fixes various defects in the API server.  
There are no changes for the frontend, the latest version of it remains 4.10.0.

**NVD Data Feed Retirement Update:**

The NVD has [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/nvd-news/c/aofnAd3HP2g) that retirement of the 
legacy data feeds has been delayed *until further notice*. Dependency-Track users who:

* ran into issues with the new NVD REST API integration, or
* did not have the time yet to migrate

can safely continue consuming the legacy feeds, or switch back to it.

**Fixes:**

* Fix alert rules not working for projects where the `ACTIVE` column is `NULL` - [apiserver/#3306]
* Fix NPE in version distance policy evaluation when project has no direct dependencies - [apiserver/#3308]
* Fix `ClassCastException` when updating an existing `ProjectMetadata#authors` field - [apiserver/#3312]
* Fix NPE in GitHub repository metadata analysis for components without version - [apiserver/#3315]
* Fix last modified timestamp for NVD mirroring via REST API not taking effect until restart - [apiserver/#3323]
