title: v4.11.0
type: major
---

**Highlights:**

* **Optimized BOM Ingestion**. The logic that governs how uploaded BOMs are processed and ingested into Dependency-Track has been
overhauled to be more reliable and efficient. Further, BOM processing is now an atomic operation, such that errors
occurring midway do not cause a partial state to be left behind. De-duplication of components and services is more
predictable, and log messages emitted during processing contain additional context, making them easier to correlate.
Because the new implementation can have a big impact on how Dependency-Track behaves regarding BOM uploads,
it is disabled by default for this release. It may be enabled in the administration panel under
*Configuration* -> *Experimental*.
* **BOM Validation**. Historically, Dependency-Track did not validate uploaded BOMs and VEXs against the CycloneDX
schema. While this allowed BOMs to be processed that did not strictly adhere to the schema, it could also lead to confusion
when uploaded files were accepted, but then failed to be ingested during asynchronous processing. Starting with this
release, uploaded files will be rejected if they fail schema validation. Note that this may reveal issues in BOM
generators that currently produce invalid CycloneDX documents. Validation may be turned off in the
administration panel under *Configuration* -> *BOM Formats*.
  * *This feature was demoed in our April community meeting! Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIeajRJK8o&t=450s)*
* **Global Vulnerability Audit View**. This new interface allows users to discover and filter vulnerabilities that affect
their portfolio, across all projects. When portfolio access control is enabled, this view is limited to projects a user
has explicit access to. It is possible to inspect individual findings, or aggregates grouped by vulnerability,
making it possible to spot the most prevalent vulnerabilities.
  * *This feature was demoed in our April community meeting! Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIeajRJK8o&t=572s).*
* **Trivy Analyzer Integration**. It is now possible to leverage [Trivy] in [server mode] for vulnerability analysis.
  * Refer to the [analyzer's documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/datasources/trivy.md %}) for further details,
  in particular the [known limitations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/datasources/trivy.md %}#known-limitations).
  * *This feature was demoed in our April community meeting! Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIeajRJK8o&t=725s).*
* **Extended Localization**. The UI now supports 12 additional languages. Users can change their language preference
in their profile settings. While the Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish translations were provided by a native speaker
(thanks [@fnxpt]!), the majority of languages are currently machine-translated. Translation improvements are a great
way to contribute to the project, please find additional details [here](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend?tab=readme-ov-file#internationalization-i18n).
* **Official Helm Chart**. The Dependency-Track project now offers an official Helm chart for Kubernetes deployments.
Community input and contributions are highly requested. The chart repository can be found at
[https://github.com/DependencyTrack/helm-charts](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/helm-charts).
It is also available through [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dependencytrack/dependency-track).

**Upgrade Notes:**

* To enable the optimized BOM ingestion, toggle the *BOM Processing V2* option in the administration panel
under *Configuration* -> *Experimental*

* The default logging configuration ([logback.xml]) was updated to include the [Mapped Diagnostic Context] (MDC)
  * Users who [customized their logging configuration] are recommended to follow this change
* Severities of vulnerabilities that previously had `NULL` severities in the database will be computed
and updated automatically upon upgrade, based on CVSSv2, CVSSv3, and OWASP Risk Rating scores

* Configuration properties for retry durations are now specified in milliseconds instead of seconds
* The following default values for configuration properties have changed:
  * `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`: 600000ms (10min) → 60000ms (1min)
* The `name` tag of the `resilience4j_retry_calls_total` for OSS Index has changed from `ossIndexRetryer` to `ossindex-api`
* The types of the following columns are changed from `VARCHAR(255)` to `VARCHAR(786)` automatically upon upgrade:
  * `COMPONENT.PURL`
  * `COMPONENT.PURLCOORDINATES`
  * `COMPONENTANALYSISCACHE.TARGET`
  * `PROJECT.PURL`
