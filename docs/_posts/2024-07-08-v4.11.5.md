title: v4.11.5
type: patch
---

This release primarily addresses an inability to mirror the NVD via its REST API. The NVD REST API recently experienced
increased load, causing service disruptions. Dependency-Track users who opted into API mirroring will have seen
symptoms of this as `NvdApiException: NVD Returned Status Code: 503` errors in the logs.

To reduce load on their systems, [NIST started to block](https://github.com/jeremylong/Open-Vulnerability-Project/issues/184#issuecomment-2214217254)
requests with a certain `User-Agent` header, which Dependency-Track happens to use. Upgrading to v4.11.5
will allow Dependency-Track to no longer be subject to this block.

Users who can't immediately update, yet are reliant on NVD data being current, can switch back to the
feed file based mirroring by disabling *Enable mirroring via API* in the administration panel.

**Fixes:**

* Fix broken NVD mirroring via REST API - [apiserver/#3940]
* Fix BOM processing V2 dispatching `BOM_CONSUMED` and `BOM_PROCESSED` notification with scope `SYSTEM` instead of `PORTFOLIO` - [apiserver/#3941]
* Fix BOM export producing invalid CycloneDX for custom licenses - [apiserver/#3942]
