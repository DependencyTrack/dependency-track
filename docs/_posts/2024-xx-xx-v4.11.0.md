title: v4.11.0
type: major
---

**Highlights:**

* **Optimized BOM Ingestion**. The logic how uploaded BOMs are processed and ingested into Dependency-Track has been
overhauled to be more reliable and efficient. Further, BOM processing is now an atomic operation, such that errors
occurring midway do not cause a partial state to be left behind. De-duplication of components and services is more
predictable, and log messages emitted during processing contain additional context, making them easier to correlate.
Because the new implementation can have a big impact on how Dependency-Track behaves regarding BOM uploads,
it is disabled by default for this release. It may be enabled by setting the environment variable `BOM_PROCESSING_TASK_V2_ENABLED`
to `true`. Users are highly encouraged to do so.

**Features:**

* Make processing of uploaded BOMs atomic - [apiserver/#3357]
* Improve performance of BOM processing - [apiserver/#3357]
* Add more context to logs emitted during BOM processing - [apiserver/#3357]
  * BOM format, spec version, serial number, and version
  * Project UUID, name, and version
* Align retry configuration and behavior across analyzers - [apiserver/#3494]

**Fixes:**

* Fix `StackOverflowError` when processing BOMs with deeply nested component structures - [apiserver/#3357]
* Fix inconsistent component de-duplication during BOM processing, causing varying components counts in successive uploads - [apiserver/#3357]
* Fix components erroneously being de-duplicated when only a single attribute of their [component identity] is identical - [apiserver/#3357]
* Fix components defined in the BOM node `metadata.component.components` not being imported - [apiserver/#3357]

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The default logging configuration ([logback.xml]) was updated to include the [Mapped Diagnostic Context] (MDC)
  * Users who [customized their logging configuration] are recommended to follow this change
* The following configuration properties were renamed:
  * `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration` → `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`
  * `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.multiplier` → `snyk.retry.backoff.multiplier`
  * `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.initial.duration.seconds` → `snyk.retry.backoff.initial.duration.ms`
  * `snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.max.duration.seconds` → `snyk.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`
* Configuration properties for retry durations are now specified in milliseconds instead of seconds
* The following default values for configuration properties have changed:
  * `ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration.ms`: 600000ms (10min) → 60000ms (1min)
* The `name` tag of the `resilience4j_retry_calls_total` for OSS Index has changed from `ossIndexRetryer` to `ossindex-api`
