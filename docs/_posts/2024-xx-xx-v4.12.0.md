**Upgrade Notes:**

* The API server now requires Java 21 or newer. Users deploying Dependency-Track via containers
don't have to do anything, since those have been shipped with Java 21 since version 4.10.0.
Users deploying Dependency-Track as JAR will need to upgrade their Java installation accordingly.
