title: v4.13.4
type: patch
---

This release primarily addresses the [removal of NVD 1.1 data feeds](https://www.nist.gov/itl/nvd), 
which caused Dependency-Track's NVD mirroring process to fail. With this release, 
Dependency-Track will consume the new 2.0 data feeds.

Users who cannot perform this upgrade immediately can configure NVD mirroring to be performed via
the NVD REST API instead. Refer to the [NVD datasource documentation] for details.

**Features:**

* Migrate to NVD 2.0 data feeds - [apiserver/#5236]

**Fixes:**

* Handle URLs in composer package metadata pattern - [apiserver/#5234]
* Fix failing TrivyAnalysisTaskIntegrationTest - [apiserver/#5241]
* Handle `adduser` / `addgroup` removal in Debian base image - [apiserver/#5246]
* Fix inconsistent ordering in findings endpoints - [apiserver/#5247]
* Fix failing Trivy OS matching for distro versions with special characters - [apiserver/#5249]
