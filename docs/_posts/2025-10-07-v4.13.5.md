title: v4.13.5
type: patch
---

**Important Notice:**

Sonatype has started to enforce an authentication requirement for OSS Index.

The [OSS Index analyzer] has historically been enabled by default for Dependency-Track,
and configuration of credentials for authentication was not strictly necessary.

This has now changed, and users who wish to continue using OSS Index will
need to register for a free account, and configure credentials in the analyzer's settings.

Please refer to [Sonatype's announcement] for further details.

In the midterm, we'll be looking into enabling OSV per default
to compensate for this change.

**Fixes:**

* Fix CPE matching not being fully case-insensitive - [apiserver/#5299]
* Improve detection whether version of a github PURL is a commit SHA or release tag - [apiserver/#5350]
* Make OSS Index credentials required - [apiserver/#5351]
* Fix occasional NullPointerException when mirroring the NVD via REST API - [apiserver/#5352]
* Fix `/api/v1/tag/policy/{uuid}` endpoint returning more tags than are assigned to a policy - [apiserver/#5353]
* Fix possible failure of NVD mirroring due to corrupted timestamp files - [apiserver/#5354]
* Fix BOM validation failing due to unrecognized new SPDX license IDs - [apiserver/#5355]
* Fix new SPDX license IDs not being recognized - [apiserver/#5356]
* Fix high CPU utilization when watchdog logger is configured - [apiserver/#5357]
* Fix NullPointerException in GithubMetaAnalyzer when analyzing GitHub Actions - [apiserver/#5359]
* Fix connection reset during OSV mirroring - [apiserver/#5360]
* Fix compatibility of custom NuGet repositories with JFrog Artifactory - [apiserver/#5381]
* Fix custom NuGet repositories not working with Sonatype Nexus - [apiserver/#5381]
* Fix possible disclosure of private NuGet repository credentials to api.nuget.org - [apiserver/#5381] / [GHSA-83g2-vgqh-mgxc]
