title: v4.13.6
type: patch
---

Starting with this release, we're publishing a new container image variant for the
*apiserver* and *bundled* distributions. The variant is based on [Alpine Linux] and uses
[jlink] to ship a minimal Java Runtime Environment (JRE). As a result, image size is decreased
by over 55% (~350MB vs. ~150MB uncompressed), and attack surface is reduced due to fewer
operating system packages. It uses Java 25 and enables [compact object headers] by default,
leading to lower memory footprint.

To use the new image variant, append the `-alpine` suffix to the image tag, e.g.:

* `docker.io/dependencytrack/apiserver:latest-alpine`
* `docker.io/dependencytrack/bundled:4.13.6-alpine`

The previous Debian-based image variant continues to be the default for now,
but will eventually be discontinued in a future release. Users experiencing
issues with `alpine` images can safely fall back to non-`alpine` variants.

**Features:**

* Add Alpine-based container variants - [apiserver/#5533]
* Update Ukrainian translation - [frontend/#1385]
