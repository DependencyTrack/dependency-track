title: Introduction

Dependency-Track is an intelligent [Component Analysis] platform that allows organizations to 
identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track takes a unique
and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of [Software Bill of Materials] (SBOM). This approach 
provides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.

Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in its portfolio in order to 
proactively identify risk across an organization. The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in 
CI/CD environments.
