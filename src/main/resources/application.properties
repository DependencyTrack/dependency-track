############################ Alpine Configuration ###########################

# Required
# Defines the number of worker threads that the event subsystem will consume.
# Events occur asynchronously and are processed by the Event subsystem. This
# value should be large enough to handle most production situations without
# introducing much delay, yet small enough not to pose additional load on an
# already resource-constrained server.
# A value of 0 will instruct Alpine to allocate 1 thread per CPU core. This
# can further be tweaked using the alpine.worker.thread.multiplier property.
# Default value is 0.
alpine.worker.threads=0

# Required
# Defines a multiplier that is used to calculate the number of threads used
# by the event subsystem. This property is only used when alpine.worker.threads
# is set to 0. A machine with 4 cores and a multiplier of 4, will use (at most)
# 16 worker threads. Default value is 4.
alpine.worker.thread.multiplier=4

# Required
# Defines the path to the data directory. This directory will hold logs,
# keys, and any database or index files along with application-specific
# files or directories.

# Defines the interval (in seconds) to log general heath information.
# If value equals 0, watchdog logging will be disabled.
alpine.watchdog.logging.interval=0

# Required
# Defines the database mode of operation. Valid choices are:
# 'server', 'embedded', and 'external'.
# In server mode, the database will listen for connections from remote
# hosts. In embedded mode, the system will be more secure and slightly
# faster. External mode should be used when utilizing an external
# database server (i.e. mysql, postgresql, etc).
alpine.database.mode=embedded

# Optional
# Defines the TCP port to use when the database.mode is set to 'server'.
alpine.database.port=9092

# Required
# Specifies the JDBC driver class to use.
alpine.database.driver=org.h2.Driver

# Optional
# Specifies the path (including filename) to where the JDBC driver is located.
# alpine.database.driver.path=/path/to/dbdriver.jar

# Optional
# Specifies the username to use when authenticating to the database.
alpine.database.username=sa

# Optional
# Specifies the password to use when authenticating to the database.
# alpine.database.password=

# Optional
# Specifies if the database connection pool is enabled.
alpine.database.pool.enabled=true

# Optional
# This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach,
# including both idle and in-use connections.
alpine.database.pool.max.size=20

# Optional
# This property controls the minimum number of idle connections in the pool.
# This value should be equal to or less than alpine.database.pool.max.size.
# Warning: If the value is less than alpine.database.pool.max.size,
# alpine.database.pool.idle.timeout will have no effect.
alpine.database.pool.min.idle=10

# Optional
# This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is
# allowed to sit idle in the pool.
alpine.database.pool.idle.timeout=300000

# Optional
# This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool.
# An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is closed will
# it then be removed.
alpine.database.pool.max.lifetime=600000

# Optional
# When authentication is enforced, API keys are required for automation,
# and the user interface will prevent anonymous access by prompting for login
# credentials.
alpine.enforce.authentication=true

# Optional
# When authorization is enforced, team membership for both API keys and
# user accounts are restricted to what the team itself has access to.
# To enforce authorization, the enforce.authentication property (above)
# must be true.
alpine.enforce.authorization=true

# Required
# Specifies the number of bcrypt rounds to use when hashing a users password.
# The higher the number the more secure the password, at the expense of
# hardware resources and additional time to generate the hash.
alpine.bcrypt.rounds=14

# Required
# Defines if LDAP will be used for user authentication. If enabled,
# alpine.ldap.* properties should be set accordingly.
alpine.ldap.enabled=false

# Optional
# Specifies the LDAP server URL
# Example (Microsoft Active Directory):
#    alpine.ldap.server.url=ldap://ldap.example.com:3268
#    alpine.ldap.server.url=ldaps://ldap.example.com:3269
# Example (ApacheDS, Fedora 389 Directory, NetIQ/Novell eDirectory, etc):
#    alpine.ldap.server.url=ldap://ldap.example.com:389
#    alpine.ldap.server.url=ldaps://ldap.example.com:636
alpine.ldap.server.url=ldap://ldap.example.com:389

# Optional
# Specifies the base DN that all queries should search from
alpine.ldap.basedn=dc=example,dc=com

# Optional
# Specifies the LDAP security authentication level to use. Its value is one of
# the following strings: "none", "simple", "strong". If this property is empty
# or unspecified, the behaviour is determined by the service provider.
alpine.ldap.security.auth=simple

# to the directory, just enough to perform searches. This should be the fully
# qualified DN of the user.
alpine.ldap.bind.username=

# Optional
# If anonymous access is not permitted, specify a password for the username
# used to bind.
alpine.ldap.bind.password=

# Optional
# Specifies if the username entered during login needs to be formatted prior
# to asserting credentials against the directory. For Active Directory, the
# userPrincipal attribute typically ends with the domain, whereas the
# samAccountName attribute and other directory server implementations do not.
# The %s variable will be substitued with the username asserted during login.
# Example (Microsoft Active Directory):
#    alpine.ldap.auth.username.format=%s@example.com
# Example (ApacheDS, Fedora 389 Directory, NetIQ/Novell eDirectory, etc):
#    alpine.ldap.auth.username.format=%s
alpine.ldap.auth.username.format=%s@example.com

# Optional
# Specifies the Attribute that identifies a users ID
# Example (Microsoft Active Directory):

#    alpine.ldap.attribute.name=uid
alpine.ldap.attribute.name=userPrincipalName

# Optional
# Specifies the LDAP attribute used to store a users email address
alpine.ldap.attribute.mail=mail

# Optional
# Specifies the LDAP search filter used to retrieve all groups from the
# directory.

# Example (ApacheDS, Fedora 389 Directory, NetIQ/Novell eDirectory, etc):
#    alpine.ldap.groups.filter=(&(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames))
alpine.ldap.groups.filter=(&(objectClass=group)(objectCategory=Group))

# Optional
# Specifies the LDAP search filter to use to query a user and retrieve a list
# of groups the user is a member of. The {USER_DN} variable will be substituted
# with the actual value of the users DN at runtime.
# Example (Microsoft Active Directory):
#    alpine.ldap.user.groups.filter=(&(objectClass=group)(objectCategory=Group)(member={USER_DN}))
# Example (Microsoft Active Directory - with nested group support):
#    alpine.ldap.user.groups.filter=(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={USER_DN})
# Example (ApacheDS, Fedora 389 Directory, NetIQ/Novell eDirectory, etc):
#    alpine.ldap.user.groups.filter=(&(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames)(uniqueMember={USER_DN}))
alpine.ldap.user.groups.filter=(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={USER_DN})

# Optional
# Specifies the LDAP search filter used to search for groups by their name.
# The {SEARCH_TERM} variable will be substituted at runtime.
# Example (Microsoft Active Directory):
#    alpine.ldap.groups.search.filter=(&(objectClass=group)(objectCategory=Group)(cn=*{SEARCH_TERM}*))
# Example (ApacheDS, Fedora 389 Directory, NetIQ/Novell eDirectory, etc):
#    alpine.ldap.groups.search.filter=(&(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames)(cn=*{SEARCH_TERM}*))
alpine.ldap.groups.search.filter=(&(objectClass=group)(objectCategory=Group)(cn=*{SEARCH_TERM}*))

# Optional
# Specifies the LDAP search filter used to search for users by their name.
# The {SEARCH_TERM} variable will be substituted at runtime.
# Example (Microsoft Active Directory):
#    alpine.ldap.users.search.filter=(&(objectClass=group)(objectCategory=Group)(cn=*{SEARCH_TERM}*))
# Example (ApacheDS, Fedora 389 Directory, NetIQ/Novell eDirectory, etc):
#    alpine.ldap.users.search.filter=(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(cn=*{SEARCH_TERM}*))
alpine.ldap.users.search.filter=(&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=Person)(cn=*{SEARCH_TERM}*))

# Optional
# Specifies if mapped LDAP accounts are automatically created upon successful
# authentication. When a user logs in with valid credentials but an account has
# not been previously provisioned, an authentication failure will be returned.
# This allows admins to control specifically which ldap users can access the
# system and which users cannot. When this value is set to true, a local ldap
# user will be created and mapped to the ldap account automatically. This
# automatic provisioning only affects authentication, not authorization.
alpine.ldap.user.provisioning=false

# Optional
# This option will ensure that team memberships for LDAP users are dynamic and
# synchronized with membership of LDAP groups. When a team is mapped to an LDAP
# group, all local LDAP users will automatically be assigned to the team if
# they are a member of the group the team is mapped to. If the user is later
# removed from the LDAP group, they will also be removed from the team. This
# option provides the ability to dynamically control user permissions via an
# external directory.
alpine.ldap.team.synchronization=false

# Optional
# HTTP proxy. If the address is set, then the port must be set too.
# alpine.http.proxy.address=proxy.example.com
# alpine.http.proxy.port=8888
# alpine.http.proxy.username=
# alpine.http.proxy.password=
# alpine.no.proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Optional
# HTTP Outbound Connection Timeout Settings. All values are in seconds.
# alpine.http.timeout.connection=30
# alpine.http.timeout.socket=30
# alpine.http.timeout.pool=60

# Optional
# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to include in REST responses.
# If 'alpine.cors.enabled' is true, CORS headers will be sent, if false, no
# CORS headers will be sent.
# See Also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
# The following are default values
# alpine.cors.enabled=true
# alpine.cors.allow.origin=*
# alpine.cors.allow.methods=GET POST PUT DELETE OPTIONS
# alpine.cors.allow.headers=Origin, Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Content-Length, Accept, Origin, X-Api-Key, X-Total-Count, *
# alpine.cors.expose.headers=Origin, Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Content-Length, Accept, Origin, X-Api-Key, X-Total-Count
# alpine.cors.allow.credentials=true
# alpine.cors.max.age=3600

# Optional
# Defines whether Prometheus metrics will be exposed.
# If enabled, metrics will be available via the /metrics endpoint.
# This endpoint is NOT subject to access control. If protection is desired,
# it must be enforced in the reverse proxy using basic auth.
# See also: https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/basic-auth/
alpine.metrics.enabled=false

# Required
# Defines if OpenID Connect will be used for user authentication.
# If enabled, alpine.oidc.* properties should be set accordingly.
alpine.oidc.enabled=false

# Optional
# Defines the issuer URL to be used for OpenID Connect.
# This issuer MUST support provider configuration via the /.well-known/openid-configuration endpoint.
# See also:
# - https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata
# - https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig
alpine.oidc.issuer=

# Optional
# Defines the name of the claim that contains the username in the provider's userinfo endpoint.
# Common claims are "name", "username", "preferred_username" or "nickname".
# See also: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoResponse
alpine.oidc.username.claim=name

# Optional
# Specifies if mapped OpenID Connect accounts are automatically created upon successful
# authentication. When a user logs in with a valid access token but an account has
# not been previously provisioned, an authentication failure will be returned.
# This allows admins to control specifically which OpenID Connect users can access the
# system and which users cannot. When this value is set to true, a local OpenID Connect
# user will be created and mapped to the OpenID Connect account automatically. This
# automatic provisioning only affects authentication, not authorization.
alpine.oidc.user.provisioning=false

# Optional
# This option will ensure that team memberships for OpenID Connect users are dynamic and
# synchronized with membership of OpenID Connect groups or assigned roles. When a team is
# mapped to an OpenID Connect group, all local OpenID Connect users will automatically be
# assigned to the team if they are a member of the group the team is mapped to. If the user
# is later removed from the OpenID Connect group, they will also be removed from the team. This
# option provides the ability to dynamically control user permissions via the identity provider.
# Note that team synchronization is only performed during user provisioning and after successful
# authentication.
alpine.oidc.team.synchronization=false

# Optional
# Defines the name of the claim that contains group memberships or role assignments in the provider's userinfo endpoint.
# The claim must be an array of strings. Most public identity providers do not support group or role management.
# When using a customizable / on-demand hosted identity provider, name, content, and inclusion in the userinfo endpoint
# will most likely need to be configured.
alpine.oidc.teams.claim=groups
