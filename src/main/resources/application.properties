############################ Alpine Configuration ###########################

# Required
# Defines the number of worker threads that the event subsystem will consume.
# Events occur asynchronously and are processed by the Event subsystem. This
# value should be large enough to handle most production situations without
# introducing much delay, yet small enough not to pose additional load on an
# already resource-constrained server.
# A value of 0 will instruct Alpine to allocate 1 thread per CPU core. This
# can further be tweaked using the alpine.worker.thread.multiplier property.
# Default value is 0.
alpine.worker.threads=0

# Required
# Defines a multiplier that is used to calculate the number of threads used
# by the event subsystem. This property is only used when alpine.worker.threads

# Optional
# This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is

alpine.ldap.users.search.filter=(&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=Person)(cn=*{SEARCH_TERM}*))

# Optional
# Specifies if mapped LDAP accounts are automatically created upon successful
# authentication. When a user logs in with valid credentials but an account has
# not been previously provisioned, an authentication failure will be returned.
# This allows admins to control specifically which ldap users can access the
# system and which users cannot. When this value is set to true, a local ldap
# user will be created and mapped to the ldap account automatically. This
# automatic provisioning only affects authentication, not authorization.
alpine.ldap.user.provisioning=false

# Optional
# This option will ensure that team memberships for LDAP users are dynamic and
# synchronized with membership of LDAP groups. When a team is mapped to an LDAP
# group, all local LDAP users will automatically be assigned to the team if
# they are a member of the group the team is mapped to. If the user is later
# removed from the LDAP group, they will also be removed from the team. This
# option provides the ability to dynamically control user permissions via an
# external directory.

# See also: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoResponse
alpine.oidc.username.claim=name

# Optional
# Specifies if mapped OpenID Connect accounts are automatically created upon successful
# authentication. When a user logs in with a valid access token but an account has
# not been previously provisioned, an authentication failure will be returned.
# This allows admins to control specifically which OpenID Connect users can access the
# system and which users cannot. When this value is set to true, a local OpenID Connect
# user will be created and mapped to the OpenID Connect account automatically. This
# automatic provisioning only affects authentication, not authorization.
alpine.oidc.user.provisioning=false

# Optional
# This option will ensure that team memberships for OpenID Connect users are dynamic and
# synchronized with membership of OpenID Connect groups or assigned roles. When a team is
# mapped to an OpenID Connect group, all local OpenID Connect users will automatically be
# assigned to the team if they are a member of the group the team is mapped to. If the user
# is later removed from the OpenID Connect group, they will also be removed from the team. This
# option provides the ability to dynamically control user permissions via the identity provider.
# Note that team synchronization is only performed during user provisioning and after successful
# authentication.
alpine.oidc.team.synchronization=false

# Optional
# Defines the name of the claim that contains group memberships or role assignments in the provider's userinfo endpoint.
# The claim must be an array of strings. Most public identity providers do not support group or role management.
# When using a customizable / on-demand hosted identity provider, name, content, and inclusion in the userinfo endpoint
# will most likely need to be configured.
alpine.oidc.teams.claim=groups

# Optional
# Define whether system requirement check is enable.
# The default value is true.
system.requirement.check.enabled=true

# Optional
# Defines the size of the thread pool used to perform requests to the Snyk API in parallel.
# The thread pool will only be used when Snyk integration is enabled.
# A high number may result in quicker exceeding of API rate limits,
# while a number that is too low may result in vulnerability analyses taking longer.
snyk.thread.pool.size=10

# Optional
# Defines the maximum amount of retries to perform for each request to the Snyk API.
# Retries are performed with increasing delays between attempts using an exponential backoff strategy.
# The initial duration defined in snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.initial.duration.seconds will be
# multiplied with the value defined in snyk.retry.exponential.backoff.multiplier after each retry attempt,

ossindex.retry.backoff.max.duration=600000

# Optional
# This flag activate the cache stampede blocker for the repository meta analyzer allowing to handle high concurrency workloads when there
# is a high ratio of duplicate components which can cause unnecessary external calls and index violation on PUBLIC.REPOSITORY_META_COMPONENT_COMPOUND_IDX during cache population.
# The default value is true.
repo.meta.analyzer.cacheStampedeBlocker.enabled=true

# Optional
# The cache stampede blocker use a striped (partitioned) lock to distribute locks across keys.
# This parameter defines the number of bucket used by the striped lock. The lock used for a given key is derived from the key hashcode and number of buckets.
# This value should be set according to your portfolio profile (i.e. number of projects and proportion of duplicates).
# Too few buckets and an unbalanced portfolio (i.e. high number of purl going to the same partition) can lead to forced serialization
# Too much buckets can lead to unnecessary memory usage. Note that the memory footprint of Striped Lock is 32 * (nbOfBuckets * 1) Bytes.
# A value between 1_000 (~32 KB) and 1_000_000 (~32 MB) seems reasonable.
# The default value is 1000 (~32KB).
repo.meta.analyzer.cacheStampedeBlocker.lock.buckets=1000

# Optional
# Defines the maximum number of attempts used by Resilience4J for exponential backoff retry regarding repo meta analyzer cache loading per key.
