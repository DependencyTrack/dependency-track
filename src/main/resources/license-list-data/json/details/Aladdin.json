All rights reserved.\n\nNOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with extra care.\n\nAladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this License to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied to a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of the appropriate country.\n\n0. Subject Matter\nThis License applies to the computer program known as \"Aladdin Ghostscript.\" The \"Program\", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Aladdin Enterprises (the \"Licensor\"). Please note that Aladdin Ghostscript is neither the program known as \"GNU Ghostscript\" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software Inc.\n\nA \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.\n\nBY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.\n\n1. Licenses.\nLicensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:\n\n     (a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program\u0027s source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.\n     (b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.\n\n2. Restrictions.\nThis license is subject to the following restrictions:\n\n     (a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program \"without charge\"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:\n\n          (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)\n          (ii) Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n     (b) Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n\n     (c) You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof (\"the Work\"):\n\n          (i) If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program\u0027s files and the date of any change. In each source file that you have modified, you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file, including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and purpose of the change;\n          (ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License;\n          (iii) If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an \"About box\", the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an announcement.);\n          (iv) You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange. The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are allowed to do so;\n          (v) If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the distribution medium;\n          (vi) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient\u0027s exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.\n\n3. Reservation of Rights.\nNo rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n4. Other Restrictions.\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n5. Limitations.\nTHE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n6. General.\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.\n\nIf any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.\n\nFor United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply:\n\nIf the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"), the Program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License.\n",
