  "licenseText": "# The Cryptographic Autonomy License, v. 1.0\n\n*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the \"License\") applies to any\nWork whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a\nsimilar demonstration of intent:*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0\n\n*or*\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception\nLicensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy License version 1.0, with\nCombined Work Exception\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the\nsoftware to which it applies (the \"Work\"), either as-is or in modified\nform, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and\ncontributors to the software from liability.\n\nThis License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third\nparties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third\nparty receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this\nLicense requires that You provide that third party all the permissions\nand materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without\nthat third party having a loss of data or capability due to your\nactions.\n\nThe full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.\n\n## 2. Receiving a License\n\nIn order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The\nrules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the\nLicensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with\nthe Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.\n\n### 2.1. Application\n\nThe terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from\nLicensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or\nimplementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of\nthe Work (a \"Modified Work\"). Unless specified, any reference to the\nWork also applies to a Modified Work.\n\n### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance\n\nThis License is automatically offered to every person and\norganization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its\nconditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this\nLicense, would infringe any intellectual property right held by\nLicensor.\n\n### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies\n\nAny failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this\nLicense places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License\nand infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the\nevent of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be\nenforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any\njurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the\nLicensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may\nenforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via\nspecific performance.\n\n## 3. Permissions\n### 3.1. Permissions Granted\n\nConditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the\nlimitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:\n\n+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent\nintellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are\nsubject; and\n\n+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to\nlicense, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as\ndistributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted\n\nThe following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section\n3.1:\n\n+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are\nonly infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by\nLicensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,\ndirectly or indirectly, with any other component, including other\nsoftware or hardware.\n\n+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service\nmarks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply\nwith the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.\n\n## 4. Conditions\n\nIf You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the\nWork, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,\ncommunicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate\nthird party (a \"Recipient\"), either via physical delivery or via a\nnetwork connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each\nRecipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the\nSource Code corresponding to the Work (\"Access\").\n\nThe \"Source Code\" of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for\nmaking modifications, including any comments, configuration\ninformation, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,\ncryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary\nfor the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and\nto have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.\n\n#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code\n\nNetwork Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You\nor by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must\npersist during the same period in which You exercise any of the\npermissions granted to You under this License and for at least one\nyear thereafter.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work\n\nSubject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each\nRecipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to\nthose portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as\nthe modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source\nCode corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be\nprovided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a\nCompatible Open Source License.\n\nA “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source \nInitiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under \nthis License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be \ndistributed together as a single work.\n\n#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities\n\nYou may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular\nmodification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the \"Embargo\nPeriod\") if:\n\n+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified\nvulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,\n\n+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end\nof the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one\nor more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,\n\n+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the\nvulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,\nand\n\n+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is\nprovided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.\n\n### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy\n\nIn addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access\nto the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this\nLicense to interfere with a Recipient\u0027s ability to fully use an\nindependent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You\nprovide with the Recipient\u0027s own User Data.\n\n\"User Data\" means any data that is an input to or an output from the\nWork, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially\nidentical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the\nRecipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,\nan existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,\nfor, or has been assigned to the Recipient.\n\n#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data\n\nThroughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions\ngranted to You under this License, You must also provide to any\nRecipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,\nprovided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient\u0027s User\nData in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is\navailable to You for use in conjunction with the Work.\n\n#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to\nanything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of\ncryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological\nprotection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient\u0027s\nability to access any functionality present in Recipient\u0027s independent\ncopy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the\nRecipient\u0027s User Data.\n\n#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access\n\nYou may not contractually restrict a Recipient\u0027s ability to\nindependently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection\nmeasures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that\nthe capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of\nenforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.\n\n### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution\n\nYou must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices\ncontained in the Source Code (the \"Notices\"), and provide all such\nNotices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the\nuse of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or\nvia an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing\nAccess to Source Code.\n\n### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License\n\nYou are required to uphold the conditions of this License only\nrelative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than\nproviding Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source\nCode, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in\nthis License requires You to provide processing services to or engage\nin network interactions with anyone.\n\n### 4.5. Combined Work Exception\n\nAs an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to\nSource Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having\nthe \"Combined Work Exception,\" or any object code exclusively\nresulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other\nSoftware into a \"Larger Work.\" So long as you comply with the\nrequirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access\nto the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide\nRecipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient\u0027s\nability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software\nin the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be\nlicensed under the terms of your choice.\n\n## 5. Term and Termination\n\nThe term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and\ncontinues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or\nuntil all Licensor\u0027s intellectual property rights in the Software\nexpire, whichever comes first (\"Term\"). This License cannot be\nrevoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.\n\n### 5.1. Effect of Termination\n\nIf this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted\nto You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You\nwill immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this\nLicense relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.\n\n### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement\n\nThis License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any\nof the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination\nfor non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License\nwill automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all\nthe conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified\nby Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your\nnoncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for\nthe Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after\nbecoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the\nWork under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance\nlasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for\nnoncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are\nspecifically restored by Licensor in writing.\n\n### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation\n\nIf You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the\nWork, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You\nby this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to\nlitigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,\ndirectly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative\nreview procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in\nresponse to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former\nLicensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due\nto litigation.\n\n## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability\n\nAs far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty\nof any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone\nfor any damages related to this software or this license, under any\nkind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a\nresult of this License or the use of the Work including, without\nlimitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer\nfailure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other\ncommercial damages or losses.\n\n## 7. Other Provisions\n### 7.1. Affiliates\n\nAn \"Affiliate\" means any other entity that, directly or indirectly\nthrough one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and\nnatural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services\nto Licensee are also Affiliates.\n\n### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n\nA Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating\nto a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only\nin the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a\nparticular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if\nLicensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to\nall Licensees.\n\n### 7.3. No Sublicensing\n\nThis License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a\nModified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a\nlicense under the terms described in this License. You may not impose\nany further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any\nRecipients\u0027 exercise of the permissions granted herein.\n\n### 7.4. Attorneys\u0027 Fees\n\nIn any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages\nrelating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,\nthe prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and\nexpenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u0027 fees\nand costs incurred in connection with such action, including any\nappeal of such action. A \"prevailing party\" is the party that\nachieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through\nsettlement. This section shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n### 7.5. No Waiver\n\nAny failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will\nnot constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit\nLicensor\u0027s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.\n\n### 7.6. Severability\n\nIf any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted\nto the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a\nconstruction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion\nwill be severed from this License but the rest of this License will\nremain in full force and effect.\n\n### 7.7. License for the Text of this License\n\nThe text of this license is released under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that\nany modifications of this license may not use the name \"Cryptographic\nAutonomy License\" or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe\nany derived work of this License.\n",
