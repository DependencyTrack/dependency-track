You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

If it is not possible to put such\n                 notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such\n                 notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look\n                 for such a notice.
