INTRODUCTION\nThe Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android (\"FDK AAC Codec\") is software that implements\nthe MPEG Advanced Audio Coding (\"AAC\") encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio.\nThis FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.\n\nAAC\u0027s HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today\u0027s most efficient general perceptual\naudio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by\nindependent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part\nof the MPEG specifications.\n\nPatent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer)\nmay be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners\nindividually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with\nthe ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license\nthese patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec\nsoftware may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.\n\nCommercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,\nare also available from Fraunhofer.
