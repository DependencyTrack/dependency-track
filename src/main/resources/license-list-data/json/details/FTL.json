The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\nThis license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n     o We don\u0027t promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is\u0027 distribution)\n\n     o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us.
