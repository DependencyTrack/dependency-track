API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.\n\nAs such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.\n\nIf you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).\n\nDefinitions:\n\n     \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n     \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n     \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n     \"You\" is you, if you\u0027re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n     \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.

It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1.
