If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n     3.4 Notices\u2028     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n     3.5 Application of Additional Terms\n\n          3.5.1 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

Termination\n\n     5.1 Failure to Comply\u2028     The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back into compliance.  Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n     5.2 Patent Infringement Claims\u2028     If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n     5.3 Additional Compliance Terms\u2028     Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5, for purposes of this Section, if You breach Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form), Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant as described in Section 5.1 must also include, no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice of such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software available in Source Code Form as required by this License on a publicly available computer network for a period of no less than three (3) years.\n\n     5.4 Contributor Remedies\u2028     If You fail to comply with the terms of this License and do not thereafter become\u2028compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable, Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to any other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action seeking injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent infringement (including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment, where available under law), for all actions in violation of rights that would otherwise have been granted under the terms of this License.\n\n     5.5 End User License Agreements\u2028     In the event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license agreements\u2028(excluding distributors and resellers), which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n6.

The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an\u2028essential part of this License.  No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party\u2019s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party\u2019s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9.

Termination\n\n     5.1 Failure to Comply\u2028     The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back into compliance.  Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n     5.2 Patent Infringement Claims\u2028     If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n     5.3 Additional Compliance Terms\u2028     Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5, for purposes of this Section, if You breach Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form), Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant as described in Section 5.1 must also include, no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice of such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software available in Source Code Form as required by this License on a publicly available computer network for a period of no less than three (3) years.\n\n     5.4 Contributor Remedies\u2028     If You fail to comply with the terms of this License and do not thereafter become\u2028compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable, Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to any other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action seeking injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent infringement (including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment, where available under law), for all actions in violation of rights that would otherwise have been granted under the terms of this License.\n\n     5.5 End User License Agreements\u2028     In the event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license agreements\u2028(excluding distributors and resellers), which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n6.

Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an\u2028essential part of this License.  No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party\u2019s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party\u2019s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9.
