Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve (12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution involve physical media.\n\n     6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled \"CHANGES\" distributed with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions.

You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License text in the Licensed Software.\n\n     6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n          a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party\u0027s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section 6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming interface (\"API\") and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n          c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n     6.4 Required Notices.\n\n          a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe recipients\u0027 rights relating to Licensed Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your name as a Contributor to the text file titled \"CONTRIB\" distributed with the Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\n          b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them.\n\n     6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.\n\n7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.

No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.\n\n     7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.\n\n8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (\"HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES\"). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.\n\n11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n12.0 Termination.

Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n\n     12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\") alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n     12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\n     12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n13.0 Miscellaneous.\n\n     13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

Nothing in this License will impair Licensor\u0027s right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.\n\n     13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\n\n     13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n     13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.\n\n     13.7 Export Restrictions.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License.
