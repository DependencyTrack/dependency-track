It applies to a given file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nThe purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf\u0027s typical output under terms of the recipient\u0027s choice (including proprietary).\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"Covered Code\" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf that is a covered work under this License.\n\n\"Normally Copied Code\" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of its Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not from its input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and non-tracing output.\n\n\"Ineligible Code\" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3. However, if by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then you void this Exception for the resulting covered work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.\n\n2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of Autoconf.\n",
